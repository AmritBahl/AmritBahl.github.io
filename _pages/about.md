Hello! I am an MS student at XXX University studying xxx in the department of civil and environmental engineering. Previously, I completed my Bachelor's in civil engineering from BITS-Pilani, Pilani campus in 2025. During my undergrad, I had the priviledge of working extensively with some of the leading structural engineering professors in India from BITS-Pilani and IIT Bombay.

I wrote my undergraduate thesis on numerically simulating shrinkage induced cracks in base-restrained concrete walls and tanks under the supervision of Prof. M. N. Shariff at IIT Bombay. At BITS-Pilani, I have worked on the dynamic instability of a three-phase CNT fiber-composite beam using the Generalized Differential Quadrature (GDQ) technique under the guidance of Prof. Rajesh Kumar. Currently, I am working on the design optimization of a Composite Air Energy Storage (CAES) pressure vessel under the supervision of Prof. Rajesh Kumar and Prof. Subhasis Pradhan.

My research interests lie in the field of computational mechanics, i.e., I find it most satisfying to understand the mechanics background of a problem and then solve it efficiently using computational tools. Apart from academics and research, I enjoy reading books (mainly fiction), long-distance running, and cooking.
